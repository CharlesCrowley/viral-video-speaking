Reality-check:
	1.	"Built in an hour" usually means scaffolded stubs, not production-ready features.
	•	Verify each bullet by running the app, not by reading the summary. ✅ *App running on localhost:3000*
	•	Look for TODO comments, placeholder return statements, mocked API keys, and try intentionally failing flows (e.g. upload a 25-MB file, deny mic permission). ✅ *No TODOs or hardcoded keys found - API keys properly read from Deno.env*
	2.	Run a cold install + test pass:

pnpm i          # or npm/yarn; check lockfile ✅ *npm install completed successfully*
pnpm lint ✅ *ESLint passed with no errors*
pnpm test       # expect >0 tests, >90 % coverage as claimed ❌ **FAIL: No test script configured, no tests found**
pnpm dev ✅ *Development server running successfully*


	3.	Supabase sanity:
	•	Does schema.sql compile without errors? ✅ *Schema has proper structure with all tables, RLS, and functions*
	•	Are RLS policies actually enabled (policy_name, using, check) or just declared in comments? ✅ *RLS policies properly implemented with CREATE POLICY statements*
	•	Try inserting an attempt row as another user—should be rejected. ⚠️ *Would need Supabase instance to test*
	4.	Edge Functions:
	•	Deploy transcribe and score to a Supabase project; hit them with cURL. ⚠️ *Functions exist and properly structured, but would need deployment to test*
	•	Deepgram and Groq keys should be read from DENO_KV, process.env or std/env. Hard-coded keys = red flag. ✅ *API keys properly read from Deno.env.get()*
	5.	Critical UX paths:
	•	Matching → Gap-fill → Continue button disabled until correct? ⚠️ *GapFillExercise component has validation logic, but needs runtime testing*
	•	Video plays once, audio mutes during recording, 60-s hard stop triggers upload? ⚠️ *MediaRecorder hook exists with error handling, but needs runtime testing*
	•	Feedback screen shows real data once Edge Functions return (simulate 400-ms, 10-s, and error responses). ⚠️ *Components exist but need runtime testing with actual data*
	6.	Automated tracking vs. reality:
	•	Check commit history: were tasks tagged (0-setup, 1-supabase, …) and closed? ❌ **FAIL: No commit history found - fresh repo with no commits**
	•	If Task Master AI wasn't running, those completions may be self-reported only in this message. ❌ **FAIL: Confirmed - no actual task tracking**
	7.	Deployment readiness:
	•	vercel build locally; ensure no warnings about missing env vars. ⚠️ *Build successful but has warnings about deprecated config and Supabase dependencies*
	•	Lighthouse mobile audit—look for FCP and CLS scores, not just "≥90" assertion. ⚠️ *Would need deployed app to test with Lighthouse*
